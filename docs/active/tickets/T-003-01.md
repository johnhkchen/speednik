## Context

Implement the ring collection, scatter, and recollection system — the core pickup mechanic and damage buffer.

Reference: docs/specification.md section 8

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ring entity: positioned in world space, collectible on player overlap
- [ ] Collection: +1 ring count, triggers SFX slot 0 (ring collect)
- [ ] 100 rings = extra life, triggers SFX slot 15 (1-up)
- [ ] Damage with rings > 0: scatter up to 32 rings outward in a burst pattern, brief invulnerability (~2 seconds / 120 frames), triggers SFX slot 7
- [ ] Scattered rings: bounce off ground, collectible for ~3 seconds (180 frames), then disappear with a fade
- [ ] Damage with rings = 0: player death, triggers SFX slot 8
- [ ] Ring counter visible in HUD (top-left), flashes when at 0
- [ ] Rings loaded from entity list (entities.json from pipeline)
- [ ] Unit tests for: collection, scatter count cap, recollection timer, 100-ring extra life
