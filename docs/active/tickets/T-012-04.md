## Context

Run all 6 player archetypes through Skybridge Gauntlet and document every finding. Skybridge
is the hardest stage with a boss encounter. Completing it requires reaching the boss arena
and defeating Egg Piston (spindash-only damage, 8 HP).

### Your role

You are a QA auditor. Document findings. Do not adjust expectations to match current
behavior.

### Expected behaviors for Skybridge

| Archetype    | min_x   | max_deaths | goal? | rationale                                 |
|--------------|---------|------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| Walker       | 2500    | 2          | no    | Can't beat boss without spindash           |
| Jumper       | 3500    | 2          | no    | Can reach boss arena but can't damage boss |
| Speed Demon  | 5000    | 1          | yes   | Spindash damages boss, should finish       |
| Cautious     | 1200    | 1          | no    | Slow progress, hostile terrain             |
| Wall Hugger  | 1500    | 2          | no    | Wall recovery in a hard stage              |
| Chaos        | 600     | 3          | no    | Random input on the hardest stage          |

Only Speed Demon should be able to complete Skybridge (boss requires spindash). But all
archetypes should make **forward progress** proportional to their capabilities. A Walker
getting stuck at x=100 on the final stage is a bug.

### Boss interaction

Speed Demon should reach the boss arena (x≈4800), engage the boss, and eventually defeat
it. The boss has 8 HP and is only vulnerable during its "vulnerable" phase. The test should
run with a high frame budget (~6000+) to allow for the full boss fight.

If Speed Demon can't damage the boss, that's a finding — either the spindash doesn't
register as an attack, or the boss state machine has a timing issue.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 6 archetype tests for skybridge
- [ ] Speed Demon test covers full boss fight with sufficient frame budget
- [ ] Boss damage verified (HP decreases, eventually BOSS_DEFEATED)
- [ ] Non-spindash archetypes expected to fail at boss (not xfailed — that's by design)
- [ ] Real bugs xfailed with tickets
- [ ] Bug tickets created for each real finding
- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/test_audit_skybridge.py -v` runs clean
