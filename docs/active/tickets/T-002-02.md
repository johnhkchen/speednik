## Context

Create the Stage 1 SVG layout and run it through the pipeline to produce playable level data. This is the first real stage and validates that the pipeline works end-to-end.

Reference: docs/specification.md section 7.1

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `stages/hillside_rush.svg` created with:
  - Dimensions: ~4800x720 viewBox
  - Section 1 (0–600): flat runway, player_start at x=64, ring arcs
  - Section 2 (600–1600): undulating terrain with 25° convex hills and concave valleys, 2–3 crab enemies on flats, rings along contours
  - Section 3 (1600–2400): 3 U-shaped half-pipe valleys with increasing depth, rings at crests, checkpoint
  - Section 4 (2400–3200): long flat/slight downhill, continuous ring line
  - Section 5 (3200–4000): full 360° loop (r=128), flat approach, rings inside loop
  - Section 6 (4000–4800): gentle downhill, scattered rings, one enemy, goal
- [ ] Pipeline produces valid tile_map.json, collision.json, entities.json, meta.json
- [ ] Validation report has zero critical flags
- [ ] `speednik/stages/hillside.py` loads the pipeline output and exposes it to the engine
- [ ] ~200 rings, 1 spring at half-pipe exit, checkpoint at section 3, goal post
- [ ] Loop geometry has correct continuous angle values around its perimeter
