## Context

Implement springs, checkpoints, launch pipes, and the liquid rise mechanic.

Reference: docs/specification.md sections 7.2 (pipe/liquid mechanics), 8

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Springs:** On player contact, override velocity in spring direction. Up springs set y_vel to a fixed upward value. Right springs set x_vel. Compressed/extended visual state. Triggers SFX slot 6.
- [ ] **Checkpoints:** On first player contact, save position + ring count as respawn point. Visual change (color swap on post). Triggers SFX slot 9. Only activates once per checkpoint.
- [ ] **Launch pipes:** Rectangular trigger zone. On player entry: override velocity to fixed vector (e.g. (10,0) for horizontal), player invulnerable during travel, exit at pipe end, resume normal physics. Visual: filled rectangle with directional arrows.
- [ ] **Liquid rise:** Triggered when player crosses liquid_trigger x-position. Liquid y-position increases at 1px/frame from bottom toward a defined ceiling. Stops when player exits zone. Liquid contact = damage (ring loss, not instant death). Visual: animated blue fill rising from bottom.
- [ ] All objects loaded from entities.json
- [ ] Unit tests for: spring velocity override, checkpoint save/restore, pipe entry/exit, liquid trigger activation and damage
