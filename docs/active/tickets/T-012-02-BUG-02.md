## Finding

Jumper archetype exits the level boundary to the right, reaching x=34023 (level_width=4800).
This triggers 5444 `position_x_beyond_right` invariant errors.

## Evidence

- Jumper max_x=34023.0 after 3600 frames
- Level width is 4800 pixels, boundary margin is 64 → violations start at x=4864
- 5444 invariant errors of type `position_x_beyond_right`
- Player is never killed or stopped by the boundary
- Goal is at x=4758 but is never triggered (jumper overshoots while airborne?)

## Expected

Player should be clamped at or near level_width. At minimum, physics should prevent
the player from advancing far beyond the right edge of the stage.

## Reproduction

```python
from speednik.qa import run_audit, format_findings, BehaviorExpectation, make_jumper

exp = BehaviorExpectation(
    name="hillside_jumper", stage="hillside", archetype="jumper",
    min_x_progress=4700, max_deaths=0, require_goal=True,
    max_frames=3600, invariant_errors_ok=0,
)
findings, result = run_audit("hillside", make_jumper(), exp)
print(format_findings(findings))
```

## Probable cause

No position clamping in `player_update` or `sim_step` for the right edge of the level.
The player freely moves past `level_width` without any collision or boundary enforcement.
