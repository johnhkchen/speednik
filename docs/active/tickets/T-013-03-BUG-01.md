## Finding

Walker and Wall Hugger archetypes get trapped in a terrain pocket at x≈413, y≈620-626
on Skybridge Gauntlet. After being launched by the spring at x=304 (y=608), they land
in a lower terrain layer composed of FULL-solidity tiles (columns 26-28, rows 38-41)
and oscillate between on_ground and jumping states indefinitely. Neither archetype can
escape because the terrain forms a closed pocket.

## Evidence

- Walker: max_x=583.6 but stuck oscillating at x≈413, y≈620-626 from frame ~350 to 6000
- Wall Hugger: identical behavior, max_x=583.6
- 3799 on_ground_no_surface warnings per run (spring tiles at (19,31) and (28,31) lack
  collision data)
- 174 quadrant_diagonal_jump warnings (angle oscillation between quadrants 0 and 2)

## Expected

Walker should walk past x=413 without getting trapped. The spring at x=304 should launch
the player to a higher platform, not into a pocket.

## Probable Cause

The lower terrain layer (FULL tiles at y≈620-640) has no exit path to the right for a
ground-only traversal. The spring launches the player into this pocket rather than onto
the main platform above. Possible causes:
1. Spring at x=304 has incorrect launch parameters (too weak or wrong angle)
2. Missing terrain connecting the pocket to the main path
3. Collision resolution doesn't push player out of FULL tile region (related to T-013-04)

## Reproduction

```python
from speednik.qa import run_audit, BehaviorExpectation, make_walker
exp = BehaviorExpectation(
    name="skybridge_walker", stage="skybridge", archetype="walker",
    min_x_progress=2500, max_deaths=2, require_goal=False,
    max_frames=6000, invariant_errors_ok=0,
)
findings, result = run_audit("skybridge", make_walker(), exp)
# max_x=583.6, stuck at x≈413 from frame 350+
```
