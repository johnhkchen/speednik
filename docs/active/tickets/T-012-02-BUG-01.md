## Finding

Walker, Cautious, and Wall Hugger strategies all get stuck at x≈601 in Hillside Rush.
The player hits a wall angle and bounces upward instead of walking smoothly through what
should be a gentle slope transition.

## Evidence

- Frame 153: angle jumps to 64 (quadrant 1, right wall) at x=601.0
- ground_speed remains at 6.0 but x_vel drops to 0.0; player is launched upward (y_vel=-5.875)
- Player arcs back down, lands around x≈614, gets trapped in angle-64/angle-0 oscillation
- Walker max_x=851.3 after 3600 frames (should reach goal at 4758)
- Cautious max_x=617.1, Wall Hugger max_x=894.6 — all blocked well short of goal

## Expected

Player should walk smoothly from x=590 through the ramp approach. Tiles (38,38) through
(41,38) have gentle angles (2, 2, 5, 5) — the transition should be smooth.

## Reproduction

```python
from speednik.qa import run_audit, format_findings, BehaviorExpectation, make_walker

exp = BehaviorExpectation(
    name="hillside_walker", stage="hillside", archetype="walker",
    min_x_progress=4700, max_deaths=0, require_goal=True,
    max_frames=3600, invariant_errors_ok=0,
)
findings, result = run_audit("hillside", make_walker(), exp)
print(format_findings(findings))
```

## Probable cause

Tile at (37, 38) — pixel x=592-608, y=608-624 — has angle=64 (wall angle) where adjacent
tiles have angle=0 (flat) and angle=2 (gentle slope). The angle=64 should be approximately
angle=2 to match the surrounding gentle slope transition. Height array is [4,4,4,4,...,5,5,5,5]
which is a slight ramp, but the wall angle causes the physics engine to treat the surface as
a right wall instead of a floor.
