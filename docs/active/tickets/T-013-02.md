## Context

Skybridge Gauntlet has a missing collision tile at column 11 (px 176–192), rows 31–32.
This creates a 16px gap in the walking surface at x≈170, and every archetype falls through
it. Adjacent columns 10 and 12 have solid tiles. The stage has spring recovery mechanisms
for later gaps but none at this first gap.

Addresses: T-012-04-BUG-01 (collision gap aspect).

## Root cause

The Skybridge collision data (`speednik/stages/skybridge/collision.json`) is missing solid
tiles at tile column 11. This is likely a pipeline artifact — either the SVG source has a
gap or `svg2stage.py` failed to rasterize that column.

## Requirements

1. Determine whether the gap is intentional (pit with missing recovery) or accidental
   (pipeline rasterization miss).

2. If accidental: patch the collision data to fill column 11 with solid tiles matching
   the adjacent columns. Regenerate via pipeline if possible, or patch directly if the
   SVG source is correct.

3. If intentional (a designed pit): ensure the pit death mechanism from T-013-01 handles
   it correctly, and add a spring or recovery platform below.

4. Verify the fix by running the Walker archetype — it should walk past x=170 without
   falling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Walker archetype traverses past x=300 on Skybridge without falling at x≈170
- No `position_y_below_world` errors in the first 500 frames of any archetype run
- Collision data has solid tiles at column 11 matching adjacent column geometry
