## Context

Bootstrap the Python project with uv, pyxel dependency, and the package directory structure. This is the foundation every other ticket depends on.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pyproject.toml` configured with uv, project name `speednik`, Python >=3.10, pyxel dependency
- [ ] Package directory `speednik/` created with `__init__.py`
- [ ] `speednik/main.py` with a minimal Pyxel app: 256x224 window, 60fps, clears screen to a color, displays "Speednik" text
- [ ] `speednik/constants.py` stub created (empty, will be populated by T-001-02)
- [ ] `speednik/stages/__init__.py` created
- [ ] `tools/` directory created
- [ ] `uv run python -m speednik.main` launches the Pyxel window successfully
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with build/run commands
