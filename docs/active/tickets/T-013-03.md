## Context

T-012-04 (Skybridge behavior audit) resulted in all 6 archetypes xfailing due to
T-012-04-BUG-01. With the collision gap fixed (T-013-02) and pit death added (T-013-01),
the audit should now produce meaningful results — some archetypes passing, others revealing
new stage-specific issues.

## Requirements

1. Re-run all 6 Skybridge archetype audits (Walker, Jumper, Speed Demon, Cautious,
   Wall Hugger, Chaos).

2. For each archetype, evaluate the result:
   - **Passes**: Remove the xfail marker from the test.
   - **Fails for a new reason**: Document the new finding, file a bug ticket if needed,
     update the xfail reason to reference the new ticket.
   - **Still fails for the original reason**: Investigate why the fix didn't resolve it.

3. Update `tests/test_audit_skybridge.py` with corrected xfail markers and any new
   assertions based on actual Skybridge traversal data (enemy positions, spring locations,
   boss arena reachability).

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least 2 of 6 archetypes pass the Skybridge audit without xfail
- All remaining xfails reference specific, documented bug tickets (not T-012-04-BUG-01)
- No archetype falls through the x≈170 gap
- Boss arena reachability is tested for Speed Demon archetype
