## Finding

Speed Demon archetype launches off a slope at x≈467 on Skybridge Gauntlet and follows
an unrecoverable aerial trajectory that ends in pit death at x≈691, y=928. The spindash
gives sufficient horizontal velocity to reach x=690, but the vertical trajectory carries
the player below the level floor with no terrain or spring to arrest the fall.

## Evidence

- Frame 100: rolling on ground at x=420, y=486 (xvel=6.3, yvel=7.2)
- Frame 120: airborne at x=467, y=413 (launched off slope)
- Frame 160: still airborne at x=593, y=441 (descending)
- Frame 200: falling at x=668, y=827 (yvel=13.6 — terminal velocity)
- Frame 217: dead at x=690, y=928 (below pit death threshold)
- max_x=690.9, expected 5000+

## Expected

Speed Demon should traverse the full Skybridge stage and reach the boss arena at x≈4800.
The spindash should carry the player across gaps, not into pits.

## Probable Cause

Combination of factors:
1. Slope at x≈430-470 launches the player high enough to clear the next platform but the
   spindash speed means the player overshoots it
2. No spring or terrain recovery mechanism between x=592 (last spring) and x=1200 (next
   spring) in the lower path
3. The spindash+slope interaction may produce too much vertical velocity (related to
   T-013-05 surface adhesion — better slope adhesion would keep the player grounded)

## Reproduction

```python
from speednik.qa import run_audit, BehaviorExpectation, make_speed_demon
exp = BehaviorExpectation(
    name="test", stage="skybridge", archetype="speed_demon",
    min_x_progress=5000, max_deaths=1, require_goal=True,
    max_frames=6000, invariant_errors_ok=0,
)
findings, result = run_audit("skybridge", make_speed_demon(), exp)
# max_x=690.9, deaths=1
```
