## Goal

Root-cause and fix the bugs surfaced by the S-012 QA audits. Every xfail that represents a
genuine engine or stage defect should flip to a pass. No test assertions are weakened — the
game conforms to the tests.

## Background

S-012 ran 6 player archetypes across 3 stages and composable mechanic probes against synthetic
grids. The result was a bug inventory of 10 tickets. Three were fixed inline (wall-angle
smoothing T-012-07, hillside loop geometry T-012-08-BUG-01, pipeworks slope wall T-012-03-BUG-01).
Seven remain open, clustering into three root causes:

### Root cause 1: No world boundaries

The simulation has no position clamping or death trigger for out-of-bounds movement. Players
walk off edges into the void forever. Affects all three stages.

- T-012-02-BUG-02: Jumper reaches x=34,023 on a 4,800px level (right boundary)
- T-012-02-BUG-03: Chaos reaches x=-49,488 (left boundary)
- T-012-04-BUG-01: All archetypes fall through missing tile at x≈170 on Skybridge and never
  die (no pit death)

### Root cause 2: Solid tile clipping

Collision resolution fails in regions with dense FULL-solidity tiles, placing the player
inside solid geometry. The player enters a bounce oscillation and gets trapped.

- T-012-03-BUG-02: Walker/Wall Hugger clip into solid tiles at x≈3040 in Pipeworks (150 errors)
- T-012-03-BUG-03: Chaos clips into solid tile at x≈100 in Pipeworks (8 errors)

### Root cause 3: Surface adhesion at high angles

The physics engine cannot maintain ground contact on steep surfaces. Players detach from loops
at the Q1→Q2 transition and from slopes above ~49°.

- T-012-06-BUG-01: Synthetic loops never reach ceiling quadrant (Q2) at any radius
- T-012-06-BUG-02: Large loops (r≥64) overshoot exit entirely (consequence of BUG-01)
- T-012-06-BUG-03: Slope adhesion fails at byte angle ≥35

## Architecture

```
T-013-01  World boundaries (x clamp + pit death)
T-013-02  Skybridge collision gap (patch tile column 11)
   │
   └──→ T-013-03  Re-run Skybridge audit (verify xfails flip)

T-013-04  Solid tile push-out hardening

T-013-05  Loop and slope surface adhesion
```

## DAG

```
T-013-01  (world boundaries)           ┐
T-013-02  (skybridge collision gap)     │ 3 concurrent
T-013-04  (solid tile push-out)         ┘
   │
T-013-02 ──→ T-013-03  (re-run skybridge audit)

T-013-05  (surface adhesion)            independent
```

Critical path: T-013-02 → T-013-03 (2 deep). Everything else is independent.

## Acceptance

- All S-012 bug-ticket xfails flip to pass (or are reclassified with rationale)
- Zero `inside_solid_tile` invariant errors on Pipeworks walker/wall-hugger runs
- Zero `position_x_beyond_right`, `position_x_negative`, `position_y_below_world` errors
- Skybridge audit produces meaningful archetype results (not 6/6 xfail)
- Synthetic loops traverse all 4 quadrants at radius 48
- Slope adhesion holds at byte angle 35
