## Goal

Two targeted fixes: replace chiptune playback with MP3 files for stage music, and correct the broken loop geometry in Hillside Rush.

## Track Breakdown

**Track A (audio):**
- T-005-01: MP3 music playback — swap pyxel.playm() for subprocess afplay on stage tracks, keep chiptune for boss/clear/gameover

**Track B (collision):**
- T-005-02: Hillside loop collision fix — correct loop circle center and remove redundant ground polygon

## DAG

```
T-005-01
T-005-02
```

No dependencies between the two tickets — they can run in parallel. Both depend on work already completed in S-004 (audio module) and S-002 (stage pipeline).
