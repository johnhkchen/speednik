## Step 2: Add Player fields and pipe bypass
- Status: complete

## Step 3: Implement springs in objects.py
- Status: complete

## Step 4: Implement checkpoints in objects.py
- Status: complete

## Step 5: Implement launch pipes in objects.py
- Status: complete

## Step 6: Implement liquid zones in objects.py
- Status: complete

## Step 7: Write tests
- Status: complete — 43 tests, all passing

## Step 8: Add entity data for pipeworks
- Status: complete
- Deviation: existing pipe_h and liquid_trigger entities were already present in entities.json (created by pipeline). Added exit/velocity fields to existing pipe entries and zone fields to existing liquid trigger entry, rather than creating new entities.

- Status: complete

## Step 10: Run full test suite
- Status: complete — 409 tests, all passing, zero regressions
