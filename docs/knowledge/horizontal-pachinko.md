# Horizontal Pachinko — Design Philosophy

## The Core Thesis: Momentum as Currency

The fundamental intent of this design is to treat momentum not as a default state of travel, but as a highly volatile currency. The player does not "walk" through a level; they negotiate with gravity, friction, and geometry to earn speed. The game world is an impartial physics table, and the player's goal is to find the path of least resistance and maximum kinetic payoff.

## 1. Gameplay Intent: The Mechanics of Joy

The gameplay is built entirely around the tension between control and chaos.

- **Earning the Spectacle**: In modern games, "spectacular" moments are often scripted cutscenes. In this framework, spectacle is strictly earned. A massive jump or a loop-the-loop only happens because the player correctly banked their momentum. The intent is to make the player feel like they "hacked" the physics engine to achieve flight.

- **Organic Difficulty (The Filter)**: There are no "Easy/Normal/Hard" menus. The environment itself filters players dynamically based on their kinetic state. High-momentum players are naturally funneled to the upper, faster, and brighter routes. When a player makes a mistake and loses their momentum, gravity pulls them down to the slower, more methodical, and hazard-heavy lower routes.

- **The "Near-Miss" Economy**: The gameplay must constantly flirt with disaster. The intent is to create a perpetual state of "falling forward." The player should always feel like they are one bad input away from losing their hard-earned velocity, mimicking the adrenaline of a gambling table.

## 2. User Values: The Psychological Payoff

Why does a player engage with this type of game? We are designing for specific psychological rewards.

- **Respect for Player Autonomy**: The physics engine is strictly impartial. If the player fails, they know exactly why (they hit a wall, they didn't have enough speed for a slope). The game never "cheats" them, but it also never holds their hand. This builds immense trust and makes mastery feel genuine.

- **The Pursuit of "Flow State"**: The ultimate user value is achieving psychological flow. By aligning the rhythmic inputs of the player with the predictable but demanding physics of the world, the player enters a trance-like state. The goal isn't just to beat the level, but to beat it with unbroken, poetic motion.

- **Tactile Satisfaction**: The player values sensory feedback. Every interaction must feel heavy, crunchy, and reactive. Bouncing off a bumper shouldn't just change the player's direction; it should trigger a cascade of audio-visual rewards that make the simple act of colliding deeply satisfying.

## 3. The Core Loop Map

To ensure every design decision aligns with these values, we can map the intended user experience directly to the design architecture.

| User Value | Gameplay Intent | Environmental Design Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Mastery | Momentum is earned. | Slopes amplify speed; flat ground bleeds it. |
| Flow | Unbroken rhythmic movement. | Obstacles should deflect (bumpers) rather than stop (walls). |
| Fairness | Impartial consequences. | No invisible walls or scripted speed boosts. |
| Discovery | High risk equals high reward. | The fastest paths require the tightest reaction times. |

> **The Design Mantra**: The world is the puzzle, physics is the language, and momentum is the solution.

By strictly adhering to these values, you build a game that doesn't rely on a famous mascot or a complex narrative to keep players hooked. They are hooked on the purest, most elemental loop in gaming: action, reaction, and the pursuit of perfect speed.
